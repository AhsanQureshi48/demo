This \"system\" is covered with microscopic hair-like structures called cilia that pulsate and clear foreign substances from your nasal membranes and out of your sinus passages. When your immune system reacts to an allergen, the mucous produced by your body becomes thick and sticky. When this occurs, your cilia are covered up by this thicker mucus and are unable to move freely to clear the membranes. In effect, the cilia become stagnant, immobile and ineffective at helping you clear out foreign substances and infections. Historically, many cultures & people have used nasal irrigation in an attempt to find relief from clogged nasal passages."
