The other end with the USB connection fits any USB wall charger and plugged into any standard outlet. The charging system will fully charge a drained battery generally within 4 hours and and hold a charge up to 21 days. It is recommended to use a standard 5V\/1A (1000mA) universal USB wall charger to avoid possible damage to the charging port. Higher wattage, rapid wall chargers are not recommended."

            "content": "One of the most important things you can do to extend rechargeable battery life is to avoid overcharging. Unlike other types of batteries that need to be recharged throughout their storage time, lithium batteries do better at 40%-50% DOD (depth of discharge). Disconnect charger and device after the battery reaches full charge. Overcharging occurs when the device or battery is plugged into a charger after full charge has been reached and may reduce battery life. Recharging battery once it reaches 40-50% state-of-charge can minimize age-related capacity loss while keeping the battery in good operating condition.",

            "content": "The water tank can be filled two ways:\n1) The fill hole is located on the back of the water tank, simply lift cover and fill.\nIf the solution stops flowing during use, it most likely is a positional issue and the supply hose that siphons the solution may not be in the remaining solution as the water tank empties if the unit is tilted too much during irrigation. It is not necessary to tilt your head to the side during irrigation with the SinuPulse Traveler and will help ensure a safer more effective irrigation over neti pots and other manual nasal wash methods that rely on gravity. This will reduce ear sensitivity and minimize any need to tilt the irrigator too much during use. Avoiding excessive tilting will help ensure that the supply hose remains in the solution during the full use as the water reservoir empties.\nHelpful tip: Ensure that the supply hose is properly positioned to the opposite side of the water tank when filled and re-assembled. This will ensure the hose remains in the solution even when the unit is tilted."

Soap and water may also be used periodically for cleaning. It is beneficial to frequently rinse the unit after use by running through a full reservoir of pure warm water til there is no more water in the reservoir and none is being ejected from the tip. Once the water has all gone, continue to allow the unit to run for about 5 seconds, to push out any residual moisture. Be sure to wipe down the unit regularly to remove any saline solution that may have spilled on the exterior to minimize accumulation of salt deposits. Rinsing the unit periodically with dilute vinegar (3:1) every 1 -3 months is recommended to help reduce mineral deposits and calcification.It's easy to keep your SinuPulseÂ® irrigator clean so you continue to get the maximum benefit for your sinus health."
