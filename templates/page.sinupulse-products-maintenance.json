On the outside bottom of the water tank you will find a small black O-ring (Fig.1a). This seals the water tank when seated on top of the SinuPulse and helps regulate water flow. \n<br><br>\nThe O-ring may be dry and require lubrication prior to first use, from a period of regular use, or after a period of inactivity. To lubricate the O-ring simply apply a very small thin application of Vaseline with your finger around the O-ring which does not need to be removed. \n<br><br>\nA small application is all that is needed to ensure optimal performance with periodic applications 2-3X annually. Clean the SinuPulse Elite regularly as directed, including periodic dilute vinegar rinse, to minimize mineral deposits and calcification which can contribute to reduced performance (flow rate) and premature wear. Use of distilled water is recommended best for long term durability. Remember to empty water tank after each use, rinse thoroughly, and allow to air dry.

If the mineral build up can be dislodged the motor and gear assembly will be free to move and should resume pumping. You may need to adjust the control knob from low to high a few times to help remove air that may have become trapped in the system and resume water flow. It is advisable to run 16 ounces of dilute white vinegar (2:1) through the unit to further break up any remaining mineral deposits and calcification. Vinegar is an excellent natural decalcifier and disinfectant."

Use of distilled water is recommended best for long term durability. <br>\nThe SinuPulse Elite is considerably different than other nasal wash products such as squeeze bottles that simply wash the nasal passages and rely on pressure alone (fire hose up the nose mentality). The higher pressure can contribute to ear sensitivity, irritation, and drive infection deeper. Pulsatile irrigation provides a safe more effective irrigation to enhance the body's natural defenses and address the underlying causes of chronic allergy and sinus problems. The SinuPulse delivers a gentle electronic pulsating saline rinse for maximum cleansing benefit. The oscillating rinse removes bacteria and debris that other nasal wash products can leave behind. At the maximum setting the SinuPulse delivers up to 24 oz in less than a minute and is 3X greater than other methods. Our pulsating rinse action has been reported in published medical journals to help break down biofilm, remove bacteria at a rate far greater than non pulsating methods, and help restore natural ciliary function. All critical for long term sinus relief and protection. Our goal is to treat the cause not simply the symptoms."

Soap and water may also be used periodically for cleaning. It is beneficial to frequently rinse the unit after use by running through a full reservoir of pure warm water til there is no more water in the reservoir and none is being ejected from the tip. Once the water has all gone, continue to allow the unit to run for about 5 seconds, to push out any residual moisture. Be sure to wipe down the unit regularly to remove any saline solution that may have spilled on the exterior to minimize accumulation of salt deposits. Rinsing the unit periodically with dilute vinegar (3:1) every 1 -3 months is recommended to help reduce mineral deposits and calcification.It's easy to keep your SinuPulse® irrigator clean so you continue to get the maximum benefit for your sinus health."
